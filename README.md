# .dotfiles

This repo contains all of my config files that I use for various programs.
Over time, I will be adding and changing what I use.

## Neovim

Create a Symbolic link to the config directory where it expects to find the
Neovim configuration directory.

```sh
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/nvim/ ~/.config/
```

## Features to add on

- [ ] Set packer to be installed automatically when loading up Neovim and it's not installed
- [ ] Add a bash script to automate installing the Neovim config Symbolic link
